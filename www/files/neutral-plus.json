// This example configuration file contains a subtle custom subjective look for generic use.
// It's called "Neutral+" as it's sort of meant to be a "better neutral" rather than some
// distinct look.
//
// The adjustments should apply well on any base profile (that is we don't have microscopic
// tunings of lightness and other things that would depend on the degree of relaxation or
// precision of the base profile)
//
// What the look does:
//  - longer rolloff to white in skin-tone range to improve look of high-key portraits
//  - shorter rolloff to white in cyan-blue-magenta to improve color of skies
//  - slight warmup of midtones and highs in greens and yellows for making sunlit
//    areas stand out more in landscapes
//  - slight saturation increase, skin-tones excluded as well as already highly saturated
//    colors
//  - slight reduction of green component in oranges to get better separation between
//    greens and reds (for landscapes)
//  - make neutrals more neutral (increases color "purity" and helps noise reduction)
//  - compress the gamut towards AdobeRGB
//
